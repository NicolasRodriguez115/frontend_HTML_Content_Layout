        <figcaption>
          This picture shows what happens during the process of osmosis. Osmosis
          is the movement of a solvent across a semipermeable membrane toward a
          higher concentration of solute. <br />
          In biological systems, the solvent is typically water, but osmosis can
          occur in other liquids, supercritical liquids, and even gases. In this
          image we can see a cup that's divided <br />
          by a semipermeable membrane. On one side of the cup we have clean
          water and on the other side we have salted water. This makes the
          molecules of clean water move to the <br />
          side of the salted water through the semipermeable membrane.

            Now you can explain to your friends what osmosis is! Even if they
            really don't care about it.
